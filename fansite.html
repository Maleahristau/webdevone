            <h3>Who Is Douglas Wreden?</h3>
            <p>Acording to his Linked-In: "In the videogame Skyrim, I create mods that spawn cheese, kill Fondle, and slaughter zombies with a potato. I also replace the statue of a woman holding a statue of a sword with a weeping man holding a statue of a sword that isn't an actual sword. And then I buy the woman a copy of Limbo. I'm a god. I call myself Diablo the Cheater. As far as I know, I'm the only person who writes a list of cheating cheats and uses it in-game. My mod turned the game into an interdimensional sex simulator (powered by a fucking necromancer), and I use that game on a daily basis. To date, I've cheated in thirty games. Twenty-one of them were developed by other users, and the other two were made by me. And today, this motherfucker is named after me. I use a relatively simple cheat to game console games. What I do is turn the switch on the controller I use into a button on the console, and then I press it to trigger cheats that give me a better experience. Here's what those che." </p>

            <h3>What Does Doug Do?</h3>
            <p>Doug is a sentient bell pepper who was hired by the FBI to crack gaming challenges and also talk about things with food. But the human that is featured in many of the videos is actually DougDoug. The most of the content that is shared under the youtube channel and Twitch streams are a mix of random challenges and lots of poor code building for mod popular video games such as GTA 5, Breath of the Wild and, Skyrim (Honestly mostly just those for the challenges) along with Mario Odyssey, Mario Party and countless other games. But what are those challenges? Anything from having twitch chat control mod menus to distract Doug as he tries to get to a location on a game's map or complete a task within the game, to spliting half of chat based on the usernames letter to create challenges for both halves of the alphabet to compete against each other to find out which side is better as flying a plane in GTA 5 or which can get a better score in Mario Party games. On top of this, there are streams that are less competitive like the stream that payed attenion to a very special Otter from the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Doug did a stream to gain money to donate to the Aquarium, while enjoying Rosa's Otter birthday and doing little tasts to enjoy her birthday and give gifts. All in all Doug has a very fun high energy stream that engages his chat and exposes a lot of people to the cool stuff simple code can create.</p>
